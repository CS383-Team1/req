\section{Functional Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Startup}
	
	On startup: system asks if you want (a) new game, (b) load game, (c)
	join game. If (a) or (b), system reports domainname/IP to you to give
	out, if you wish, to other players to join you. Starts up listening at
	port 4500 (default) or configurable port.
	
	\item \textbf{Drop-in Multiplayer}
	
	 Drop-in drop-out multiplayer functionality
\end{itemize}

\section{Functional Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Single/Multi-player}
	
	Plays standalone or multiplayer, scaling up to 27 players
	
	\item \textbf{Server Functionality}
	
	Peer-to-peer connection to a "server" thread allows remote player
	interaction with the application via a proxy thread
	
	\item \textbf{Dungeon Naming} % Ronald Rodriguez
	
	As this game is going to be set in a Sci-fi world, it would make sense, on 
	initial thought, to erase the idea of using the term "dungeon" to describe 
	the environment one is in during a mission, and instead referring to it as 
	a "site" or a "facility" or something of that nature. We believe, however, 
	that it may be too early in the planning stages of the game to make this 
	decision definitively. We may very well end up having some "themed" levels 
	that take place inside of a computer that could most definitely be referred 
	to as dungeon-esque. 
	
	\item \textbf{Level Editor}
	
	Use whatever internal data structure(s) your software design calls
	for, but the external file format of levels is: ASCII-art text; i.e.
	Emacs or Vi can be your level editor.
	
	\item \textbf{Setting 1}
	
	Setting: the game starts at the Spaceport America, a 28 square mile
	complex located in the Jornada del Muerto region in New Mexico, the
	center of modern commercial space travel. See its Map. Your levels may
	start with approximations of the major buildings, starting with the more
	office/administrative buildings and working towards the space operations
	buildings.
	
	\item \textbf{Setting 2}
	
	Levels 1..k are relatively ordinary "office" training levels. There is
	no death in the initial levels; the emphasis is on social standing,
	promotion, bureaucracy, verbal jousting, maybe the occasional photobomb,
	copy machine prank, toner theft, etc. See the Wikipedia article on
	verbal self defense. NPC friends that you make here, if you gain enough
	faction with them, will follow and aid you semi-autonomously. Interface
	is text/ASCII-art, roguelike. 
	
	\item \textbf{Setting 3}
	
	Levels k+1..m are "cyber" levels, with death=dumped out of cyberspace.
	Tron-like. Emphasis is on knowledge discovery, resouce acquisition,
	virus combat. Interface is tile-based, 2D graphical, nethacklike.
	Real-time until you hit "engagements" by entering enemy
	zones-of-control; then turn-based.
	
	\item \textbf{Setting 4}
	
	Levels m+1..n are "space station" levels, with death=game over.
	Emphasis is on combat with alien weapons and/or computer cyberattacks.
	Interface is tile-based, enhanced (or 2.5D?) graphical. 
\end{itemize}

\section{Rejected Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Player Threads}
	
	System views each player as a thread, thread sends/receives messages
	to a "controller" thread that manipulates game state.
	
	It was originally proposed that the system will view each player as a
	thread, allowing those threads to send and receive messages from a
	controller thread which manages the game state. This requirement has been
	rejected for being too specific. While this is a good solution to the
	general gameplay requirements, we believe it is better to keep this as a
	suggestion rather than a requirement.
	
	\emph{Description by Mason Fabel}
		
	\item \textbf{3-D Gameplay}
	
	We said tile-based, not 3D FPS. If you want to do 3D in 480/481 or
	428, knock the 2D version out of the park 
	
	It was mentioned that expanding this project to include 3D graphics might
	be a future possibility. We believe that designing this project in such a
	way to intentionally leave this path open is a distraction from the main
	purpose of the game, and thus this should not be a requirement.
