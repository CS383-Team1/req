\chapter{Functional Requirements}

\begin{section}{Casey Blair}
\begin{subsection}{Drop-in Drop-Out Functionality (Casey Blair)}
When user’s start the game, they will be asked if they want to join an
existing game hosted by another user. New users can join and leave other
users’ games without the need to start a new multiplayer game. This allows
for a more fluid gaming experience as new users can come and go as they
wish without interrupting other users’ progress. And with up to 27 users
joining one game, this will be necessary to have a fluid gameplay
experience that isn’t constantly being interrupted by new users wanting to
join.
\end{subsection}
\end{section}

\begin{section}{Mason Fabel}
\begin{subsection}{Startup}
Upon being launched, the game will present the player with a simple menu
consisting of three items: ``New Game'', ``Load Game'', and ``Join Game''.
If one of the first two items is selected, the player's hostname and IP
address will be reported so that other players can potentially join the
game. A thread will then begin listening for joins at port 4500 by default,
or another port if the player has previuously configured the game to run
over an alternative port.
\end{subsection}
\end{section}

\chapter{Rejected Requirements}

\begin{section}{Mason Fabel}
\begin{subsection}{Threading}
It was originally proposed that the system will view each player as a
thread, allowing those threads to send and recieve messages from a
controller thread which manages the game state. This requirement has been
rejected for being too specific. While this is a good solution to the
general gameplay requirements, we believe it is better to keep this as a
suggestion rather than a requirement.
\end{subsection}

\begin{subsection}{3D Graphics}
It was mentioned that expanding this project to include 3D graphics might
be a future posibility. We believe that designing this project in such a
way to intentionally leave this path open is a distraction from the main
purpose of the game, and thus this should not be a requirement.
