Starting from Dr. J's Requirements Doc, BY SUNDAY 10PM, build a document that lists your proposed requirements:

* It should be a LaTeX doc that will be a section in our overall\ semester project doc.

* It should have two sections, functional and non-functional

* Team vote on each Dr. J requirement, and if the majority wants to reject/replace that requirement, write me a brief explanation.

* Add any functional or nonfunctional requirements that you think should be agreed on up front
