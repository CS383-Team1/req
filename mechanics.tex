\section*{Mechanics}

\subsection*{Combat}
Our combat system will be JRPG style. 
The character will run into enemies in the map and be transitioned
 into a battle mode. The battle mode will be used for combat and 
 conversations. From there, characters can choose their actions for each 
 turn. 

\subsection*{Turns}

Turns are used to regulate play and denote the passage of time. 
In our game, turns will represent the passage of time, but will 
not represent a realistic passage of time. 

Our turns will be represented by ticks in game play where default
actions will be performed if no other action is chosen. 
In this way, all players will contribute to the actions of a single 
turn. Each tick, characters will perform actions, like attacking,
regaining health, speaking, and making save checks. 

A mechanism for determining which character's actions are performed
first in a turn will exist, based on character statistics like how much
caffeine they have in their system. 

\subsection*{Action Points}

Characters will have some form of action points which control how 
many actions the character can perform each turn in combat. Actions
that can be regulated by action points include attacks, attempts to 
flee, item usage, and special actions. 
Whatever we call this in the game, it is merely a way to control
how many actions, can be taken each turn. 

There are a few things we should decide about how to regulate actions.
\begin{itemize}
\item Is it possible for characters to gain more actions?
\item Do characters gain more actions at higher levels. 
\item Do characters gain more actions with better equipment.
\item What are the relative costs of different actions 
\item Are there actions that every character always gets, such as speaking, or changing weapon? 
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Resource Management}
A mechanic of a lot of games is resource management. 
This involves regulating and replenishing resources like 
ammo, coffee, health items, and other expendable resources. 
Players can replenish their resources from sources such as
co-workers, other players, vending machines, and the refrigerator. 

\subsection*{Worker Placement}
A mechanic of some games is worker placement. This involves
directing workers to perform a tasks while the player does 
something else. 

If we implement this, it will probably take the form of 
directing interns or secretaries to do paperwork, 
bring the character coffee, or spread gossip about characters. 

\subsection*{Saving}
The game will have checkpoints throughout it where the player can save. 
Players can teleport among checkpoints. They can also trade with other 
players at checkpoints, and can be resurrected at checkpoints if they die. 

\subsection*{Winning}
Winning in this game will involve reaching the end of the game, 
and possibly defeating an end boss. After a player wins, the 
game will be open world for them to explore, find hidden areas, 
and collect awesome gear. 

\subsection*{Losing}
The game will have checkpoints periodically throughout. If a player 
dies in the game, they will be resurrected at the last checkpoint they
checked in at in the state they checked in. The player may also lose
a small amount of reputation when they die. It is noted that this 
penalty must be small enough so that they game is still fun, even 
with frequent deaths. 

\subsection*{Trading}
The game will allow trading between players, but this can only be done
at checkpoints where saving can be done, to prevent duplication of items.

\subsection*{Character Creation}
Character Creation will consist of filling out a job application type form, 
with details for the character's physical appearance, like hair and eye color. 
This may include a preview of the character being created, so players can see
their avatar before committing. This feature is included for the story. 

\subsection*{In-Game Time}
This section is a wishlist item. 

The game will include an in-game clock. There will be an in-game work week
for which different events happen at certain times. These events could include:
\begin{itemize}
\item vending machine refills
\item NPCs calling in sick 
\item special NPCs presence or absence
\end{itemize}

Another feature of the in-game time is dreamland levels for players who
do not wish to go to work at night. 

\subsection*{Other}
We plan to have the main quest line for our game take 7-10 hours for completion.
