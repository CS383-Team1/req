\begin{subsection}{Drop-in Drop-Out Functionality (Casey Blair)}
When user’s start the game, they will be asked if they want to join an existing game hosted by another user. New users can join and leave other users’ games without the need to start a new multiplayer game. This allows for a more fluid gaming experience as new users can come and go as they wish without interrupting other users’ progress. And with up to 27 users joining one game, this will be necessary to have a fluid gameplay experience that isn’t constantly being interrupted by new users wanting to join.
